AWS Organizations practicals
Create an AWS account (you being the root user).
Invite (through email or Account ID)another member.
create an organizationatl unit
move the member to that OU
create and attach a deny policy. (prerequisite, the member has to have that as a fULL access policy: ex. s3 full acess)
Now ask him/her to create S3 bucket.
Verification: S3 creation will fail though the member has S3 full access (SCP will prevent him)
