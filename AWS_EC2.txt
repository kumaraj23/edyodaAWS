Followed all steps mentioned in session for EC2 instance creation through IAM user..
And I understand the concepts.

Create an IAM user (Adminuser) with EC2 full Access.
The Permission must come from Group.(admingroup)
login through that user (adminuser) and create an EC2 instance.
Leave everything as default. in EBS storage leave "Delete on Termination" checked. (dont uncheck)
Create instance. and try to delete the instance (Terminate)
See if the underlying volume is also deleted (EBS volume)
